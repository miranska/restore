Version: 0.1.0
Author: Andriy Miranskyy and Lei Zhang
Maintainer: Andriy Miranskyy <avm@ryerson.ca> and Lei Zhang <leizhang@ryerson.ca>
Description: This is a package of regression testing for dataset migration. Given a scenario where a legacy dataset will be replaced by a target dataset, we will analyze the difference between them based on following tests:
  1. Distribution test: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;
  2. Correlation tests: Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation;
  3. Different variables and records;
  4. Magnitude comparison;
  5. Mean relative errors;
  6. The difference between two hierarchical pairs in Spearman's test;
  7. Features that have NA values;
  8. Hybrid tests, which shows features that appear in Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, mean relative error test, and correlation tests;
  9. Ranking, which shows the ranking of variables that appear in Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, mean relative error test, and correlation tests.
  The final report will be written into a user-specified xlsx file or an object (which is stored in an RData file). Users can choose the test results produced in the final report.
