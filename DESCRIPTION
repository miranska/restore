Description: This is a package of regression testing for dataset migration. Given a scenario where a legacy dataset will be replaced by a target dataset, we will analyze the difference between them based on following tests:
   1. Distribution test: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
   2. Correlation tests: Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation.
   3. Mean relative errors.
   4. The difference between two hierarchical pairs in Spearman's test.
   5. Features that have NA values.
   6. Hybrid tests, which shows features that appear in Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, mean relative error test, and correlation tests.
   The final report will be written into a user-specified xlsx file or an object (which is stored in an RData file). Users can choose the test results produced in the final report.
